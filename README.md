# RetinalOCTTransferLearningResNet

In this project, I create a ResNet model that classifies pathologies in Retinal OCT scans with 99.59% test set accuracy

**A further description is found in the Google Colab**

Retinal OCT image dataset was found from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/kermany2018)
